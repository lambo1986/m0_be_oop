# Self-Evaluation

- This final CFU encompassed everything you've learned in Mod 0, and maybe even required some learning outside of what you've explicitly been taught. How did it feel as you faced these challenges? ***It was really challenging, but I had the time to get it done and I learned how to search for resources on google a little bit better.***
- How is your workflow going, in terms of taking breaks, staying focused, etc.? ***I've been pretty good at taking breaks every hour or so, sometimes more often. Staying focused can be tough, especially when something is giving me trouble. It's easier to get distracted when facing a challenge.***
- What did you learn from this exercise that you want to remember as you begin Mod 1?
***I learned the value of being a good question-asker, and I need to sharpen this skill. I also finished part of my assignment with the help of a classmate! Without her help I would have struggled for hours. Teamwork is key.***
